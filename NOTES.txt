the brain is set up in groups for 3 different types:
memory modules store data
sensors find data to store
tasks use the stored data to take action
in the tick method, the axolotl calls this.getBrain().tick and then AxolotlBrain.updateActivities(this)
brain is created in the LivingEntity using deserializeBrain. this is overridden in the axolotl
createBrainProfile is used to add modules to the brain stuff
see SENSORS and MEMORY_MODULES in the axolotl class initializer
